# 🏠 ALX Listing App

## 📖 Project Overview
The **ALX Listing App** is a modern web application inspired by **Airbnb**, designed to showcase property listings in an elegant and responsive interface.  
It demonstrates the use of **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build reusable UI components and maintain scalable project architecture.  

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, efficient, and modular foundation for a property listing platform — focusing on accessibility, performance, and code clarity.
